# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is software that our computers use in order to be able to modify and do things to files that would normally be done to the regular user via the graphical user interface. Git in a way, provides a simpler and more streamlined way to manage and modify files and directories. Github, is a website where one can manage one's files. Sort of like a cloud service. With Github, we can upload, share, and download files and data, then, if one wants, modify that data and re-upload to the cloud, which is Github.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system that is used by over 90% of software developer. It is used to store collaborative projects where everyone who is working on said project can contribute. Its free, it's fast, and it's convenient.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The Javascript operators that will return boolean values are conditionals. They deal exclusively with booleans. Also operators such as is

Researched answer: There are three operators that output boolean values: &&, ||, and !=. These operators are widely used and are very important for JavaScript.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is where something is located. It is also used for loops. A Value can be anything in the programming language. Numbers are an example of values.

Researched answer: a number that indicates where something is stored in something such as a string or an array. Values are chunks of data; this data can range anywhere from text, to numbers, to functions, and basically anything that is used in JavaScript.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are collections of data that can be accessed by stating what you want and where you want it. They are also numbered within these arrays. One can specify where one wants to find this array by simply referring to its place within the array. Strings are something that is plain english text or letters; these are usually wrapped inside of single or double quotes or back ticks if one wants to concatenate. Strings differ from arrays in the way that arrays can be a collection of different types of data; one index can be a string, while the next can be a number, and so on. Strings are usually just text. Strings and arrays are similar, however, in the way that we can access specific things inside of those strings by indicating the number where that one letter is inside of the string.

Researched answer: Strings and arrays are similar such that they can be accessed via specifying an index one wants to access. Arrays, however, can contain any data type.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming techniques enable a pair of programmers to team up and help each other get through a problem or set of problems. Each teammate takes turns in "driving", or doing the work first-hand, whilst the other "navigates", or directs the other by giving them instructions, or help steer them in the right direction. After a certain amount of time, these roles are swapped in order to allow each team-mate to get equal amounts of experience in both roles.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a method that is widely used by software developers. This is where a team of two share the task at hand, allowing each team member to get equal exposure to doing the work versus navigating. Developers take turns doing each one of these two tasks. This can be done remotely or in person, and usually involves one work station(if in person). There are several benefits of pair programming, such as: fewer coding mistakes, sharing each other's knowledge, and helping the developers understand that nothing in software development is done by a single person alone.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that basically accepts another function as a parameter and also can return another function. Essentially, higher order functions are more complex functions.

2. Jest: Jest is a free framework that allows user to test code and ensure correctness of said code. 

3. Objects: An object is a collection of properties. These objects can have properties inside of them which do certain tasks.

4. Method: A method is an action that can be performed on an object. Methods are often object properties, or actions that are perfomed on objects.

5. Classes: From what I can understand, classes are basically chunks, or a part of objects. They are basically the organs of objects. So an object is composed of different classes.
